Q: What changes do you need to make to include these new recipes in your database?
A: not much, it was already done last week. But as an improvement I added step_no to recipe_steps table and measurements to recipe_ingredients

Q: Where can you add a primary key?
A: for recipes, ingredients and steps the first column is ID column and it's a primary key( recipe_id, ingredient_id, step_id). For the other tables there are composite primary keys 

Q: Which tables should be linked with a foreign key?
A: our middle tables like recipe_categories. It has two columns recipe_id and category_id. first one is linked to recipes table and second one is linked to category table with foreign key

A: relations are visible in ./db.png (crows feet notation)
