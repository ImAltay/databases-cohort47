What are the collections?
    A collection is the equivalent of a table in a relational database system

What information will you embed in a document and which will you store normalised?

    I will embed ingredients and steps in an array. only one collection. 

What made you decide when to embed information? What assumptions did you make?
    I believe this way I give more freedom to user. instead of ketchup maybe they would like to write heinz ketchup.

If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, which one would you
choose and why?

    I think for this task noSQL is better. there is a limited amount of information.
